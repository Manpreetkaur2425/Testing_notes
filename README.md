# Principle of software testing
This are the principle with basically gives you a mindset that excetlly the software testing.

1.Testing showes the presence of defects.
2.Exhaustive testing is not possible.
3.Early Testing.
4.Defect clustering.
5.Pesticide Paradox.
6.Testing is contex deoendent.
7.Absence of error fallacy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.Testing shows the presence of defects: 
It means software testing reduce the presence of defects
Software testing talk about the presence of defects& we doesn't talk about the absence of defects.
Even multiple testing can never ensure that software is 100% bug free.

2.Exhaustive testing is not possible:
 It means the software can never test at every test cases.
 It can test only ssome test cases & assume that software is correct and it will produce the correct output in every test cases.
 It is impossible a software can not be 100% tested cannot be possible 
 (any kind of software with exhaustivelly)

3.Early testing:
 The defect detected in early phases of SDLC will very less expective for better performance of software testing will start at initial phase.

4.Defect Clustering:
 In a project, a small number of module can contain most of the defects.
 Pareto Principle to software testing state that 80% of software defect comes from 20% of modules.

5.Pesticide Paradox:
 Repeating the same test cases again and again will not find new bugs.
 It is necessary to review the test cases and add or update test cases to find new bugs.

6.Testing is context depentent:
 Testing approach depends on context of software developed.
 (different types of software we need to perform different from the testing of the android application)

7.Abesence of errors fallacy:
 If a built software is 99% bug free but is does not follow the requirement then it is unusable. 
 It's not only necessary that the software is 99% bug free but it also mandatory to fulfill all the customer requirements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we are developing a software and it is perfect software but it is not upto the user requirement then it is no need a software.
when we are doing manual testing. we need to takecare of the seven principle to keep in a mind.
